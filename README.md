<p> The Enterprise School Management System is a system that is expected to deliver quality school day to day activities. It is not developed to remove what happens in the schools but to simplify what happens in the schools. This system is to be used by different actors including;
    <ol>
        <li>Parents/Guardians</li>
        <li>Teachers</li>
        <li>Students</li>
        <li>Directors</li>
    <ol>
 Below, we explain in details how each of the above persons interacts with the system. We hope that with future we shall be able to integrate with the non-teaching staff.

        <h3>1. Parents(Guardians):</h3>
        <p>
            A parent or a guardian is a person who has all responsibility over a student. The parents are to access this system in order to view the accademic performace of their children in both Examinations and Tests. The parent also can track the students attendence on a daily basis per taught subject. The parents login to this system using the generated user name and there NIN as there password. On the parents dashbord, they see a list of all the students they take care of and can see all the school fees payment status. Once the status is pending, they can see the total amount of money being demanded as a sum and for individual basis.
