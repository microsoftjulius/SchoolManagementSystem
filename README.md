<p> The Enterprise School Management System is a system that is expected to deliver quality school day to day activities. It is not developed to remove what happens in the schools but to simplify what happens in the schools. This system is to be used by different actors including;
    <ol>
        <li>Parents</li>
        <li>Teachers</li>
        <li>Students</li>
        <li>Directors</li>
    <ol>
   We hope that with future we shall be able to integrate with the non-teaching staff
